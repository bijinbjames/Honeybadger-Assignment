Slack Alert Web Endpoint
========================

This is a simple Flask web application that accepts a JSON payload as a POST request and sends an alert to a Slack channel if the payload matches the desired criteria.

Requirements
------------

-   Python 3.x
-   Flask
-   Slack API token
-   Slack channel ID

Getting Started
---------------

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:

Copy code

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/slack-alert-web-endpoint.git`

1.  Install the required Python packages using pip:

Copy code

`pip install flask slack-sdk slack-bolt`

1.  Set the environment variables for your Slack API token and channel ID:

Copy code

`export SLACK_APP_TOKEN=your_app_token
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
export SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id`

1.  Start the Flask web application:

Copy code

`python app.py`

Usage
-----

Once the Flask web application is running, you can send a JSON payload to its endpoint (`http://localhost:5000/`) using a tool like Postman or cURL. The JSON payload should match the desired criteria to trigger an alert in your Slack channel.

Here's an example JSON payload that matches the desired criteria:

jsonCopy code

`{
  "RecordType": "Bounce",
  "Type": "SpamNotification",
  "TypeCode": 512,
  "Name": "Spam notification",
  "Tag": "",
  "MessageStream": "outbound",
  "Description": "The message was delivered, but was either blocked by the user, or classified as spam, bulk mail, or had rejected content.",
  "Email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "From": "notifications@honeybadger.io",
  "BouncedAt": "2023-02-27T21:41:30Z"
}`

Deployment
----------

To deploy this Flask web application to a production server, you can use a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI. Here's an example command to start the application with Gunicorn:

Copy code

`gunicorn app:app`

Make sure to set the environment variables for your Slack API token and channel ID on the production server as well.
